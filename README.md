# Online_News_Prediction_Parallel_Processing
The dataset summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable
(an online news organization) in a period of two years. The goal is to predict the number of
shares of these news articles. It is a classic regression problem which we will solve using -
Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression
and Gradient Boosted Trees Regression. We will use parallel processing at different stages
of the implementation of this problem (using Spark Mllib) and compare the performance with
sequential processing (using Scikit Learn). Further, we will draw inferences based on
performance and computation time of these two approaches.
